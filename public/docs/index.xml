      <description>Matplotlib is a plotting library. In this section give a brief introduction to the matplotlib.pyplot module.
Installation Install via pip:
pip install matplotlib Import As Matplotlib builds on the NumPy library, you have to import both.
import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Create a basic plot # Compute the x and y coordinates for points on a sine curve x = np.arange(0, 3 * np.pi, 0.1) y = np.</description>

      <description>Intro to NumPy Python Library Numpy official documentation:
The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
NumPy doesn’t depend on any other Python packages, however, it does depend on an accelerated linear algebra library - typically Intel MKL or OpenBLAS. Users don’t have to worry about installing those
For the basics intro see: https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html
Installation Via conda or pip:
pip install numpy Import Customary way to import:
import numpy as np Numpy Arrays A NumPy array is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of nonnegative integers.</description>

SciPy docs
The SciPy library builds on the NymPy&amp;rsquo;s library multidimentional arrays and offers a large number of functions that operate on them.
It is useful for different types of scientific and engineering applications.
The SciPy.stats sub-library. Within the .stats sub-library, we see functions for continuous and discreet distributions, descriptive statistics, and also statistical test such as T-test.</description>
