Using pictures. Vizualising data is preferable not just because most people rather look at pictures than at numbers, but it can also reveal trends that are not obvious instantanously, especially when looking at a large data set. Choosing how to visualize data depends on the type of data and the goal of the visualization.\nTypes of data\r#\rQuantitative variables are numerical, measurable quantities in which arithmetic operations often make sense. These can be:\nContinuous: could take on any possible value within an interval, many possible values. For example: height, weight, time Discrete: countable value, finite number of values: has to take an integer value. For example: a number of children in a household Qualitative (Categorical) variables classify individuals or items into different groups.\nOrdinal: groups that have an order or ranking For example: student ranking Nominal: doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any associates ranking with ranking with it. For example: marital status Pie Chart, Bar Graph, and Histograms\r#\rQualitative data: pie chart or dot plot Comparison is easier on the dot plot Pie chart is better at showing the percentage of the total that the category represents Problems with pie charts\r竊表r- Very small slices might overlap - it is hard to compare slices without proper labeling: it is easier to compare when looking at a bar chart\rQuantitative(numbers): bar chart and histogram Bar chart: pnly the height of the bars is meaningful Histogram: allows to use bars with different widths representing frequency distribution. Four main aspects of histograms\r竊表r1. Shape: overall shape of a histogram:\r- symmetric\r- bell-shaped (unimodal: has one peak)\r- left-skewed\r-right-skewed\r2. Center: mean or median\r3. Spread: how far the data spread:\r- Range\r- Interquartile Range (IQR)\r- standarn deviation\r- variance\r4. Outliers: data points that fall far from the bulk of the data\rBox Plot and Scatter Plot\r#\rBox plot - also called Box-and-Whisker Plot\nProviding Context is Key for Statistical Analyses\r#\rThe purpose of a statistical analysis is typically to compare the observed data to some kind of reference. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s very useful to provide context in graphical displays. There\u0026rsquo;s a nice explanation of this in the book \u0026lsquo;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information\u0026rsquo; by Edward Tufte.\nPitfalls when Visualizing Information\r#\rAvoid flashy graphics Generally 3D graphics are making it harder to read the information Edward Tufte is the authority in the field of visualisation.

These are the 25th and 75th percentiles of our data and so the distance between them gives us that middle 50 percent for how spread out the middle 50 percent of our data is. The final two numbers are the min and the max. That, of course, will give us the overall range for all of our data.
