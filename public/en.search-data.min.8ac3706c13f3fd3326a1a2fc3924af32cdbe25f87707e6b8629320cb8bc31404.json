Using pictures. Vizualising data is preferable not just because most people rather look at pictures than at numbers, but it can also reveal trends that are not obvious instantanously, especially when looking at a large data set. Choosing how to visualize data depends on the type of data and the goal of the visualization.\nProviding Context is Key for Statistical Analyses\r#\rThe purpose of a statistical analysis is typically to compare the observed data to some kind of reference. Therefore, it\u0026rsquo;s very useful to provide context in graphical displays. There\u0026rsquo;s a nice explanation of this in the book \u0026lsquo;The Visual Display of Quantitative Information\u0026rsquo; by Edward Tufte.\nPitfalls when Visualizing Information\r#\rAvoid flashy graphics Generally 3D graphics are making it harder to read the information Edward Tufte is the authority in the field of visualisation.

The number of dimensions is the rank of the array. The shape of the array is the tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.\nShape of the array\r#\rThe shape of the array gives you the dimesions and the number of values. Use the dot function to acces the shape of the array:\nprint(np.shape(test-array)) Create an array with same values\r#\rNumPy gives a functionality of creating an array containint the same values.\nAn array containing zeros only. The input are the dimensions of the array: zero-array = np.zeros((3, 2)) # (3,2) specifies the dimensions of the array An array containing ones only: zero-array = np.ones((3, 2)) # (3,2) specifies the dimensions of the array Full constant array with specified value\nconstant-values-array = np.full((3,3), 9) # (3,3) specifies the dimensions of the array # 9 specifies the constant value Random array\r#\rGet the values of the NumPy array\r#\rSlicing a NumPy array\r#\r"},{"id":2,"href":"/docs/example/","title":"Statistics introduction","section":"Docs","content":"\rAbout\r#\rIn this section I am collecting notes and resources from the Introduction to Statistics course from Standford University, provided by Coursera.org.\nI am also following Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python course.

These can be:\nContinuous: could take on any possible value within an interval, many possible values. For example: height, weight, time Discrete: countable value, finite number of values: has to take an integer value. For example: a number of children in a household Qualitative (Categorical) variables classify individuals or items into different groups.\nOrdinal: groups that have an order or ranking For example: student ranking Nominal: doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any associates ranking with ranking with it.

Q3: the Third Quartile, or the 75th percentile of the data Max: largest data point Min and max gives us a range.
