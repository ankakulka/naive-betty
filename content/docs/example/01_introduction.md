# Descriptive statistics for exploring data

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding the basics of descriptive statistics and its tools
- Getting familiar with important principles for visualizing information
- Ability to apply knowledge and understand descriptive statistics of real data

You can summarize data in two ways:
1. Using nummerical summaries.
2. Using pictures.

Vizualising data is preferable not just because most people rather look at pictures than at numbers, but it can also reveal trends that are not obvious instantanously, especially when looking at a large data set.
Choosing how to visualize data depends on the type of data and the goal of the visualization. 

## Types of data

**Quantitative** variables are  numerical, measurable quantities in which arithmetic operations often make sense.
These can be:
1. **Continuous**: could take on any possible value within an interval, many possible values.
    For example: height, weight, time
2. **Discrete**: countable value, finite number of values: has to take an integer value.
    For example: a number of children in a household

**Qualitative** (Categorical) variables classify individuals or items into different groups. 
1. **Ordinal**: groups that have an order or ranking
    For example: student ranking
2. **Nominal**: doesn't have any associates ranking with ranking with it.
    For example: marital status

### Providing Context is Key for Statistical Analyses

The purpose of a statistical analysis is typically to compare the observed data to some kind of reference. Therefore, it's very useful to provide context in graphical displays. There's a nice explanation of this in the book 'The Visual Display of Quantitative Information' by Edward Tufte.

### Pitfalls when Visualizing Information

- Avoid flashy graphics
- Generally 3D graphics are making it harder to read the information

Edward Tufte is the authority in the field of visualisation.

## Assessment

1. Question 1
The following five questions are focused around a public library. Staff members are trying to gain insight on current library card holders and have sent out a short survey to them. Read each prompt carefully and determine the variable type for each question.

Library card holders were asked whether or not they have checked out a book from the library in the past month (yes or no). What type of variable would their response be considered?
- **Categorical Nominal**
- Categorical Ordinal
- Quantitative Continuous
- Quantitative Discrete

2. Question 2
Library card holders were asked to report the amount of late fees they have been charged in the past year (input in the form of $XX.XX). What type of variable would their response be considered? 
- Quantitative Continuous

3. Library card holders were asked to reflect on their most recent book they checked out and report the genre that it most closely represented (i.e. Science Fiction, Action, Romance, Mystery, etc.). What type of variable would their response be considered?

- Categorical Nominal

4. The library recently added a new online checkout/renewal system. Library card holders were asked how many times they have used the new online system. What type of variable would their response be considered?
- Quantitative Discrete

5. Question 5
Library card holders were asked to report the satisfaction of their library experience during their last visit using a 1 to 5 scale (with the following representations: 1 - Extremely Unsatisfied, 2 - Unsatisfied, 3 - Neutral, 4 - Satisfied, 5 - Extremely Satisfied). What type of variable would their response be considered?

- Categorical Ordinal
