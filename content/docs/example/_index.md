# About

In this section I am collecting notes and resources from the [Introduction to Statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/stanford-statistics/home) course from Standford University, provided by Coursera.org.

I am also following [Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-visualization-data/home/week/2) course. This course is part of the [Statistics with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics-with-python).
