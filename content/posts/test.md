Health insurance for freelancers: voluntary statutory or private?


Anyone who has founded a company finds themselves in the comfortable situation of being able to choose at the beginning of their self-employment whether they want to take out voluntary statutory health insurance or prefer private health insurance. This decision is not trivial, as both have advantages and disadvantages - but once you have switched to the private system, it is not easy to return to the statutory health insurance scheme.

In this guide, you will find an overview of what voluntary statutory health insurance means, how statutory health insurance differs from private health insurance and how the contributions are calculated in each case.

**What does it mean: Voluntarily insured - and yet compulsory?**

Why is it even called "voluntarily insured" if we have compulsory health insurance in Germany, i.e. every citizen has to take out health insurance? The reason for this is that above a certain income ("contribution assessment ceiling"), you can - but do not have to - opt out of statutory insurance. All self-employed people even have the choice between private and statutory health insurance. In all these cases, you become a voluntary member of statutory insurance if you choose this option.

If you are self-employed, you can choose whether you want to be part of the statutory health insurance system voluntarily or take out private health insurance. No matter what you decide: As a self-employed person, you are responsible for the entire amount of the contributions, as no employer can cover half of them (one exception is the Künstlersozialkasse for artists and writers).

**What are the advantages of the Voluntary statutory health insurance?**

Voluntary statutory health insurance has advantages over private health insurance companies when it comes to the range of benefits: While private insurers are quite free to decide what they contractually guarantee their customers, the catalogue of benefits offered by health insurance companies is fixed by law and gives them little scope to differ from one another. Unlike private insurers, they cannot simply restrict or exclude economically sensitive service areas - e.g. mental illness. *Statutory health insurance must cover everything that is considered medically necessary*. 
In addition to this basic principle of a broad range of benefits, the most important arguments in favour of statutory cover are as follows: 
 *Only your income counts*: In statutory health insurance, only the amount of your income is used to calculate your monthly contribution - other factors are not taken into account. 

The situation is different with private insurance companies: They enquire very carefully about your state of health and also take your age into account when calculating your premium. This means that your premium for private health insurance is low if you are young and healthy. However, it can quickly become quite high if you are older or if you have pre-existing conditions when you take out the policy. For example, if you have a chronic illness, this does not matter for statutory health insurance, but it does for private health insurance. This can result in benefit exclusions or premium surcharges.

Family insurance: In statutory health insurance, you can also insure your children and (if they do not earn money themselves) your spouse. They are then part of the "family insurance" and do not pay their own contributions. Private insurers do not offer this - each person must be insured individually. As already mentioned, the decisive criterion for co-insuring your family is their unemployment: If your partner has no income at all or at most income from marginal employment, you can co-insure them.
No advance payments: Have you ever seen a doctor's bill? 

There's a simple reason for this: the statutory health insurance fund automatically takes care of paying them. Sure - sometimes additional payments are due, for example when buying medication at the pharmacy. But at least you don't have to make full advance payments. If you have private health insurance, the bills will first arrive in your letterbox - and you usually have to pay them before you can submit them to your health insurance company to get the money back. In view of standard medical fees and high medicine prices, this can temporarily have a drastic impact on your account balance. Here too, statutory health insurance companies definitely score points.

So what are the arguments in favour of private health insurance?

The often better benefits offered by private health insurers are particularly worth mentioning here. Although their scope varies greatly - and this is also a challenge when choosing a provider and tariff - it can certainly be greater than that offered by statutory health insurance companies. As a private patient, you can often expect preferential treatment, fast appointments and single rooms for inpatient treatment in hospital.

The situation is different for statutory health insurance patients: Long waits for appointments at the specialist practice are possible in some regions; you can't choose whether and with whom you share your room in hospital. Co-payments for medication and dental prostheses can also be expensive in the short term - although this is usually still no comparison to the monthly costs of private health insurance.

Once you have decided in favour of private health insurance, please note that you can only switch back to statutory health insurance in exceptional cases - as a rule, this is not possible in order to prevent "cherry-picking" from the two systems as far as possible.In addition, the favourable rates and potential savings for young people compared to statutory health insurance are reversed if the rates increase with age or if additional contributions that are included in the statutory system suddenly become due due to children or partners who are not working.
Health insurance card is on the keyboard
How high is the contribution to voluntary statutory health insurance?

Basically, the costs of voluntary health insurance under the statutory system are fairly straightforward.We show you what is taken into account when calculating the contribution:
    Basi    
Basic contribution: This is 14.6 per cent of your income (as of 2020). We'll explain what all falls under the term "income" in a moment.
     
Additional contribution: Depending on the health insurance company, an additional contribution may be due, which is also based on your income. It is not fixed by law, but is levied (or not) by each health insurance company at its own discretion. The average amount is currently around 1.1 per cent.

Sickness benefit:     
When you take out insurance, you can decide to waive the payment of sickness benefit - this reduces your premium to the basic rate of 14 per cent of your income. Whether this makes sense is another matter. After all, you are otherwise entitled to sickness benefit from the 43rd day of illness and it amounts to 70 per cent of your gross income.
     
Your income:Here you not only have to take into account your income from your main occupation as a self-employed person, but also interest income and/or rental income. So if you have a nice fixed-term deposit account or rent out a property, your health insurance company will want to know this and adjust its contribution accordingly.
     
Minimum contribution: There is a minimum contribution in statutory health insurance, or rather: a minimum assessment basis. This amounts to EUR 1,061.67 per month in 2020.If you earn less, your contribution will still be calculated based on this figure.If you receive sickness or maternity benefit, the minimum assessment threshold does not apply during this time - the contributions are then based on your actual income.

Contribution assessment ceiling: If your self-employment is going very well, then the contribution assessment ceiling may be of interest to you.    
Your income above this limit is not taken into account.In 2020, it is EUR 4,687.50 (gross) per month.If you earn more, you will still only ever pay the maximum amount based on this assessment ceiling.
Long-term care insurance: As a person with voluntary statutory health insurance, you are automatically covered by long-term care insurance.The contribution is 3.05 per cent of your income if you have children - otherwise it is 3.3 per cent.
     
Part-time self-employment: If you are self-employed part-time, do not work as an employee and earn no more than EUR 455 per month, you can remain in the family insurance scheme without paying contributions.
Start-up subsidy: Are you eligible for this support?Then be careful: The start-up subsidy is added to your income and increases your contribution rate accordingly.An exception to this is a lump sum of EUR 300, which is intended for basic social security and is not taken into account in the amount of your income.

For comparison: The billing model of private health insurers

If you want to take out private health insurance, the first step is to choose your own tariff.


This can be quite confusing due to the immense selection of offers - it is therefore worth taking a closer look at the benefits of private health insurance.One thing is clear: the better the benefits on offer, the higher your premium.

However, this is not the only criterion for calculating private health insurance premiums.The following also play a role

Your age (the older you get, the higher the premium)
Your state of health and any pre-existing conditions
your occupation (and any resulting health risk)
    other persons to be insured (partner, children)
The consumer magazine Finanztest has calculated that the premium for private health insurance can triple when you reach retirement age compared to the initial premium. This can mean, for example, that as a single founder in your mid-30s you pay a lower rate than at the same time in statutory health insurance, but this triples over the years. It is therefore essential that you consider this risk when switching to private health insurance and build up reserves over the course of your life to cover this difference.

Because one thing is clear: both systems will ultimately have to solve the same problems: 
Medical costs rise with age, the age pyramid is increasingly turning upside down and our healthcare system is becoming more and more efficient - and therefore more expensive.The statutory system solves this by creating the largest possible pool of members, in which the young and healthy virtually subsidise the contributions of the old and sick.Anyone who wants to must be accepted into this system. Private insurers, on the other hand, tackle the same challenges with individual agreements:To exaggerate somewhat, everyone there pays for their statistical risk: that's why the premiums are so different. And anyone who represents too great a risk from the insurance company's point of view is not even offered an acceptable contract.
Part-time self-employed and voluntarily covered by statutory health insurance - is that possible?

If you work as an employee, i.e. you are in a dependent employment relationship, there is usually nothing to stop you from being self-employed in addition to your regular job.Normally, however, you are still compulsorily insured in a statutory health insurance fund - just like any other full-time employee.

However, as a part-time self-employed person, you are obliged to report your income from this work to your health insurance fund.In some circumstances, the health insurance fund will not only adjust your contributions (income from self-employment is included in your income), but will also check whether your self-employed work should actually be considered your main job - for example, because you invest significantly more time in it or because you earn more with it than with your other job.

The following criteria apply to part-time self-employment:

You work less than 20 hours per week in this activity.
You earn less than in your main job.
You have no employees; one marginally employed person is permitted.
You do not receive a start-up grant.

If you do not fulfil one of these criteria, your health insurance provider may classify your self-employment as your main occupation.
This means that you have to take out voluntary insurance yourself and pay the full contributions. However, you can switch back to compulsory insurance as an employee at any time if you can prove that you are only self-employed on a part-time basis.
For artists and publicists: the artists' social insurance fund
As a self-employed artist or publicist, you have the option of applying for admission to the Künstlersozialkasse (KSK). You will remain a member of your health insurance fund, but your contributions (including care and pension) will then be topped up by the KSK as if you were an employer. This means that instead of paying the usual contributions, you only pay half - which can make things a lot easier for you, especially in the early years. You are also covered by pension insurance through the KSK, which freelancers normally have to do themselves with a subsidised or private pension scheme. One does not exclude the other, but it can't hurt either.


**Artists social security**

Admission to the artists' social security fund is subject to certain conditions:

As a self-employed artist or publicist, you have the opportunity to apply for membership of the Künstlersozialkasse (KSK).    
You will remain a member of your health insurance fund, but your contributions (including care and pension) will then be topped up by the KSK as if you were an employer.This means that instead of paying the usual contributions, you only pay half - which can make things a lot easier for you, especially in the early years. You are also covered by pension insurance through the KSK, which freelancers normally have to do themselves with a subsidised or private pension scheme. One does not exclude the other, but it can't hurt either.

Admission to the artists' social security fund is subject to certain conditions:
You must work full-time and independently as an artist or publicist.

Your minimum income (from self-employed work) must be EUR 325 per month.However, this does not apply to young professionals in the first three years.

You do not have more than one employee - unless it is a marginal employment.
You carry out your work in Germany.

You can find out all the important details about the KSK, your application for membership, the calculation of your monthly contribution and the annual income report in our start-up platform guide to the Künstlersozialkasse.

Conclusion: Voluntary statutory health insurance offers security

To summarise: voluntary statutory health insurance is worthwhile, especially in the long term. Because even if it seems expensive compared to private health insurance, especially at the beginning, and supposedly offers poorer benefits (longer waiting periods, higher co-payments), its contributions are not dependent on your health and age.Ultimately, politics is the unknown factor here:Depending on how the social consensus on health develops and how future governments shape health policy, contributions could rise significantly if the population develops as it has in Germany.Thanks to the contribution assessment ceiling, however, you can at least always work out the maximum amount you will have to pay if you are self-employed and doing well.
Once you have private health insurance, there is usually no going back, even if you have difficulties earning the rising contributions at some point. On the other hand, good private insurers offer you a range of services that can exceed the quality of statutory health insurance - you just have to ask yourself how important this is to you personally.

Going freelance in Germany



Freelancers (Freiberufler) are self-employed entrepreneurs who work simultaneously for multiple clients and employers. Unlike tradespeople (Gewerbetreibende), they usually operate under their own name rather than a company name and do not have to register with the trade office or pay trade tax. Freelancing in Germany is therefore a flexible occupation open to both Germans and expats alike.
How to become a freelancer in Germany

In comparison with registering as a tradesperson, there are relatively few administrative issues involved with becoming a freelancer in Germany. There are, however, a few bureaucratic hurdles to overcome before you can start working for yourself.
Definition of a freelancer (Freiberufler) vs tradesperson (Gewerbetreibende)

Before you can go about setting yourself up as a freelancer in Germany, you need to make sure that you qualify as one according to German law. Legally, there is a distinction in Germany between freelancers (Freiberufler) and tradespeople (Gewerbetreibenden). This distinction has important implications for business registration and tax purposes.

Freelancers in Germany are defined as those who work in so-called “Liberal Professions” (freie Berufe), including:

    Lawyers, tax consultants, accountants
    Engineers, architects
    Doctors, dentists, vets, therapists, psychologists
    Journalists, interpreters, translators, writers, teachers
    Artists, photographers, musicians, designers, actors

Anyone else is not considered a freelancer but a tradesperson, and must subsequently register their business with the trade office and pay trade tax. You can find out more about this process on our How to start a business page.

Ultimately, the final decision as to whether a profession is considered freelance or trade rests with the tax office (Finanzamt), which evaluates professions on a case by case basis. If you are unsure, consult with your local tax office.
Residence permit

Before you can start working as a freelancer, you need to make sure that you are entitled to live and work in Germany. Citizens from the EU, EEA and Switzerland are free to undertake freelance work in Germany without restriction.

Nationals of other countries need to have the appropriate residence permit that allows you to work in a self-employed capacity. Freelancers in their visa and residence permit applications need to prove that they already have clients set up in Germany. This can be demonstrated with letters of intent from companies wishing to hire you or invoices for businesses you have already worked with.   
How to go freelance in Germany: Register with the tax office

To register as a freelancer in Germany, you need to fill in a “Fragenbogen zur steuerliche Erfassung” (Questionnaire for Taxation) and submit it to your local tax office. You can either download, fill out the form and submit a physical copy, or complete it online via ELSTER. You must complete the form in German.

If you have any queries or concerns, it is recommended to get in touch with a tax advisor, who can make sure all information is submitted correctly. There are also a number of online services, for instance Sorted, that can handle your freelancer registration with the tax office and even take care of submitting your tax reports.

If you choose to contact the tax office yourself, you will need to provide the following details:

    Tax ID
    Description of your freelance activity
    Details of your German bank accounts (both personal and business, if you have one)
    Estimated business revenue and expenses
    Estimated profit
    Whether you wish to charge VAT (see below)

The tax office will determine on the basis of your answers whether you qualify as a freelancer. They will then issue you with a tax number (different from a tax ID), a unique identifier given to you as a business entity which needs to be quoted on all invoices and on your tax return. You will also receive a VAT number, if you requested one.
German business taxes

You will also receive a payment plan from the tax office, laying out the taxes you must pay, on the basis of your turnover predictions. Depending on your estimated income, you may be required to pay income tax and VAT monthly, quarterly or yearly via an annual tax return. Learn more about the types of taxes freelancers in Germany have to pay on our Business taxes page. 

Freelance administration

Freelancers in Germany need to keep their business affairs in impeccable order. An accountant or a tax advisor can help you with this. If you are audited, the tax office can request records going back 10 years.
Correctly formatting invoices

Make sure that all your invoices are correctly formatted and contain the following information:

    Your full name and address
    The full name and address of the recipient
    Date of invoice
    Your tax number and VAT number (if applicable)
    Unique invoice number, assigned by you
    Description of work undertaken or service provided
    Net amount
    VAT / USt (if applicable)

Fictitious self-employment (Scheinselbständigkeit)

As a freelancer, you need to make sure you don’t fall foul of German laws regarding “fictitious self-employment” (Scheinselbständigkeit), which occurs when someone who is ostensibly a freelance worker is deemed to be an employee (Angestellter). This might arise if you have had only one client over an extended period of time, or generate too much income from a single client.

The tax authorities may decide that you were, in fact, employed, and therefore owe social security contributions and income taxes for as long as you worked with the employer.
Insurance & Pensions for freelancers

As freelancers are not subject to compulsory social security contributions, you will need to take care of your own insurance cover.
Health insurance for freelancers

Having health insurance is mandatory in Germany. Being covered by statutory health insurance automatically qualifies you for long-term care insurance and sickness benefit. The scheme also provides cover for your dependent family members. Freelance workers can voluntarily contribute to a statutory health insurance scheme, although bear in mind that you will usually need to cover the whole contribution (around 14,6% of your income) yourself.

The only exception to this is certain artistic professions, such as PR workers, artists and writers, who can apply to the Künstlersozialkasse (KSK) for a 50% contribution towards health and pension insurance.

For many freelance workers, private health insurance may work out cheaper, as the premiums are based on your relative risk factor (i.e. your age and general health), rather than a proportion of your salary. If you opt for a private scheme, you need to make sure you are also covered for long-term care and in the event of your inability to work due to sickness.
Freelancers’ pensions

Freelance workers are often obliged to continue making contributions to a statutory pension insurance plan. This is true for anyone working in the following fields:

    Healthcare
    Architecture
    Engineering
    Law
    Accountancy
    Teaching
    Art
    Writing

Other freelance workers can choose to make voluntary contributions to a state pension. You will need to inform your pension fund. The main benefit of being voluntarily-insured is that you can determine the exact level of your contributions, as long as they exceed the minimum contribution level of 18,6% of your income.

As a freelancer, this 18,6% burden is paid by you in its entirety. If you are a member, the Künstlersozialkasse (KSK) will cover 50% of your contributions. Alternatively, you can apply for a 50% reduction to your contributions for the first three calendar years after you become self-employed, to help you support yourself during your development phase. Your local branch of the Deutsche Rentenversicherung will advise you as to whether you are eligible for this reduction.

If you do not work in one of the professions that are obliged to contribute, and you do not wish to voluntarily contribute, you can choose to take out a private pension plan, such as a Rürup pension.
Unemployment insurance

In order to safeguard against any potential disruption to your business in the future, it would also be wise to make voluntary contributions to the statutory unemployment insurance scheme. This will make sure you qualify for unemployment benefit, should you ever need it.
Occupational accident insurance

You can choose to take out voluntary accident insurance for yourself (and your spouse, if they work with you). If you have any employees, you will be obliged to make contributions to the scheme on their behalf.
Start-up grants for unemployed

If you have lost your job and are considering freelance work as an alternative to unemployment benefit, you may be entitled to a start-up grant to help get your new business up on its feet.
