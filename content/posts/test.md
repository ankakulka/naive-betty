Health insurance for freelancers: voluntary statutory or private?


Anyone who has founded a company finds themselves in the comfortable situation of being able to choose at the beginning of their self-employment whether they want to take out voluntary statutory health insurance or prefer private health insurance. This decision is not trivial, as both have advantages and disadvantages - but once you have switched to the private system, it is not easy to return to the statutory health insurance scheme.

In this guide, you will find an overview of what voluntary statutory health insurance means, how statutory health insurance differs from private health insurance and how the contributions are calculated in each case.

**What does it mean: Voluntarily insured - and yet compulsory?**

Why is it even called "voluntarily insured" if we have compulsory health insurance in Germany, i.e. every citizen has to take out health insurance? The reason for this is that above a certain income ("contribution assessment ceiling"), you can - but do not have to - opt out of statutory insurance. All self-employed people even have the choice between private and statutory health insurance. In all these cases, you become a voluntary member of statutory insurance if you choose this option.

If you are self-employed, you can choose whether you want to be part of the statutory health insurance system voluntarily or take out private health insurance. No matter what you decide: As a self-employed person, you are responsible for the entire amount of the contributions, as no employer can cover half of them (one exception is the Künstlersozialkasse for artists and writers).

**What are the advantages of the Voluntary statutory health insurance?**

Voluntary statutory health insurance has advantages over private health insurance companies when it comes to the range of benefits: While private insurers are quite free to decide what they contractually guarantee their customers, the catalogue of benefits offered by health insurance companies is fixed by law and gives them little scope to differ from one another. Unlike private insurers, they cannot simply restrict or exclude economically sensitive service areas - e.g. mental illness. *Statutory health insurance must cover everything that is considered medically necessary*. 
In addition to this basic principle of a broad range of benefits, the most important arguments in favour of statutory cover are as follows: 
 *Only your income counts*: In statutory health insurance, only the amount of your income is used to calculate your monthly contribution - other factors are not taken into account. 

The situation is different with private insurance companies: They enquire very carefully about your state of health and also take your age into account when calculating your premium. This means that your premium for private health insurance is low if you are young and healthy. However, it can quickly become quite high if you are older or if you have pre-existing conditions when you take out the policy. For example, if you have a chronic illness, this does not matter for statutory health insurance, but it does for private health insurance. This can result in benefit exclusions or premium surcharges.

Family insurance: In statutory health insurance, you can also insure your children and (if they do not earn money themselves) your spouse. They are then part of the "family insurance" and do not pay their own contributions. Private insurers do not offer this - each person must be insured individually. As already mentioned, the decisive criterion for co-insuring your family is their unemployment: If your partner has no income at all or at most income from marginal employment, you can co-insure them.
No advance payments: Have you ever seen a doctor's bill? 

There's a simple reason for this: the statutory health insurance fund automatically takes care of paying them. Sure - sometimes additional payments are due, for example when buying medication at the pharmacy. But at least you don't have to make full advance payments. If you have private health insurance, the bills will first arrive in your letterbox - and you usually have to pay them before you can submit them to your health insurance company to get the money back. In view of standard medical fees and high medicine prices, this can temporarily have a drastic impact on your account balance. Here too, statutory health insurance companies definitely score points.

So what are the arguments in favour of private health insurance?

The often better benefits offered by private health insurers are particularly worth mentioning here. Although their scope varies greatly - and this is also a challenge when choosing a provider and tariff - it can certainly be greater than that offered by statutory health insurance companies. As a private patient, you can often expect preferential treatment, fast appointments and single rooms for inpatient treatment in hospital.

The situation is different for statutory health insurance patients: Long waits for appointments at the specialist practice are possible in some regions; you can't choose whether and with whom you share your room in hospital. Co-payments for medication and dental prostheses can also be expensive in the short term - although this is usually still no comparison to the monthly costs of private health insurance.

Once you have decided in favour of private health insurance, please note that you can only switch back to statutory health insurance in exceptional cases - as a rule, this is not possible in order to prevent "cherry-picking" from the two systems as far as possible.In addition, the favourable rates and potential savings for young people compared to statutory health insurance are reversed if the rates increase with age or if additional contributions that are included in the statutory system suddenly become due due to children or partners who are not working.
Health insurance card is on the keyboard
How high is the contribution to voluntary statutory health insurance?

Basically, the costs of voluntary health insurance under the statutory system are fairly straightforward.We show you what is taken into account when calculating the contribution:
    Basi    
Basic contribution: This is 14.6 per cent of your income (as of 2020). We'll explain what all falls under the term "income" in a moment.
     
Additional contribution: Depending on the health insurance company, an additional contribution may be due, which is also based on your income. It is not fixed by law, but is levied (or not) by each health insurance company at its own discretion. The average amount is currently around 1.1 per cent.

Sickness benefit:     
When you take out insurance, you can decide to waive the payment of sickness benefit - this reduces your premium to the basic rate of 14 per cent of your income. Whether this makes sense is another matter. After all, you are otherwise entitled to sickness benefit from the 43rd day of illness and it amounts to 70 per cent of your gross income.
     
Your income:Here you not only have to take into account your income from your main occupation as a self-employed person, but also interest income and/or rental income. So if you have a nice fixed-term deposit account or rent out a property, your health insurance company will want to know this and adjust its contribution accordingly.
     
Minimum contribution: There is a minimum contribution in statutory health insurance, or rather: a minimum assessment basis. This amounts to EUR 1,061.67 per month in 2020.If you earn less, your contribution will still be calculated based on this figure.If you receive sickness or maternity benefit, the minimum assessment threshold does not apply during this time - the contributions are then based on your actual income.

Contribution assessment ceiling: If your self-employment is going very well, then the contribution assessment ceiling may be of interest to you.    
Your income above this limit is not taken into account.In 2020, it is EUR 4,687.50 (gross) per month.If you earn more, you will still only ever pay the maximum amount based on this assessment ceiling.
Long-term care insurance: As a person with voluntary statutory health insurance, you are automatically covered by long-term care insurance.The contribution is 3.05 per cent of your income if you have children - otherwise it is 3.3 per cent.
     
Part-time self-employment: If you are self-employed part-time, do not work as an employee and earn no more than EUR 455 per month, you can remain in the family insurance scheme without paying contributions.
Start-up subsidy: Are you eligible for this support?Then be careful: The start-up subsidy is added to your income and increases your contribution rate accordingly.An exception to this is a lump sum of EUR 300, which is intended for basic social security and is not taken into account in the amount of your income.

For comparison: The billing model of private health insurers

If you want to take out private health insurance, the first step is to choose your own tariff.


This can be quite confusing due to the immense selection of offers - it is therefore worth taking a closer look at the benefits of private health insurance.One thing is clear: the better the benefits on offer, the higher your premium.

However, this is not the only criterion for calculating private health insurance premiums.The following also play a role

Your age (the older you get, the higher the premium)
Your state of health and any pre-existing conditions
your occupation (and any resulting health risk)
    other persons to be insured (partner, children)
The consumer magazine Finanztest has calculated that the premium for private health insurance can triple when you reach retirement age compared to the initial premium. This can mean, for example, that as a single founder in your mid-30s you pay a lower rate than at the same time in statutory health insurance, but this triples over the years. It is therefore essential that you consider this risk when switching to private health insurance and build up reserves over the course of your life to cover this difference.

Because one thing is clear: both systems will ultimately have to solve the same problems: 
Medical costs rise with age, the age pyramid is increasingly turning upside down and our healthcare system is becoming more and more efficient - and therefore more expensive.The statutory system solves this by creating the largest possible pool of members, in which the young and healthy virtually subsidise the contributions of the old and sick.Anyone who wants to must be accepted into this system. Private insurers, on the other hand, tackle the same challenges with individual agreements:To exaggerate somewhat, everyone there pays for their statistical risk: that's why the premiums are so different. And anyone who represents too great a risk from the insurance company's point of view is not even offered an acceptable contract.
Part-time self-employed and voluntarily covered by statutory health insurance - is that possible?

If you work as an employee, i.e. you are in a dependent employment relationship, there is usually nothing to stop you from being self-employed in addition to your regular job.Normally, however, you are still compulsorily insured in a statutory health insurance fund - just like any other full-time employee.

However, as a part-time self-employed person, you are obliged to report your income from this work to your health insurance fund.In some circumstances, the health insurance fund will not only adjust your contributions (income from self-employment is included in your income), but will also check whether your self-employed work should actually be considered your main job - for example, because you invest significantly more time in it or because you earn more with it than with your other job.

The following criteria apply to part-time self-employment:

You work less than 20 hours per week in this activity.
You earn less than in your main job.
You have no employees; one marginally employed person is permitted.
You do not receive a start-up grant.

If you do not fulfil one of these criteria, your health insurance provider may classify your self-employment as your main occupation.
This means that you have to take out voluntary insurance yourself and pay the full contributions. However, you can switch back to compulsory insurance as an employee at any time if you can prove that you are only self-employed on a part-time basis.
For artists and publicists: the artists' social insurance fund
As a self-employed artist or publicist, you have the option of applying for admission to the Künstlersozialkasse (KSK). You will remain a member of your health insurance fund, but your contributions (including care and pension) will then be topped up by the KSK as if you were an employer. This means that instead of paying the usual contributions, you only pay half - which can make things a lot easier for you, especially in the early years. You are also covered by pension insurance through the KSK, which freelancers normally have to do themselves with a subsidised or private pension scheme. One does not exclude the other, but it can't hurt either.


**Artists social security**

Admission to the artists' social security fund is subject to certain conditions:

As a self-employed artist or publicist, you have the opportunity to apply for membership of the Künstlersozialkasse (KSK).    
You will remain a member of your health insurance fund, but your contributions (including care and pension) will then be topped up by the KSK as if you were an employer.This means that instead of paying the usual contributions, you only pay half - which can make things a lot easier for you, especially in the early years. You are also covered by pension insurance through the KSK, which freelancers normally have to do themselves with a subsidised or private pension scheme. One does not exclude the other, but it can't hurt either.

Admission to the artists' social security fund is subject to certain conditions:
You must work full-time and independently as an artist or publicist.

Your minimum income (from self-employed work) must be EUR 325 per month.However, this does not apply to young professionals in the first three years.

You do not have more than one employee - unless it is a marginal employment.
You carry out your work in Germany.

Conclusion: Voluntary statutory health insurance offers security

To summarise: voluntary statutory health insurance is worthwhile, especially in the long term. Because even if it seems expensive compared to private health insurance, especially at the beginning, and supposedly offers poorer benefits (longer waiting periods, higher co-payments), its contributions are not dependent on your health and age.Ultimately, politics is the unknown factor here:Depending on how the social consensus on health develops and how future governments shape health policy, contributions could rise significantly if the population develops as it has in Germany.Thanks to the contribution assessment ceiling, however, you can at least always work out the maximum amount you will have to pay if you are self-employed and doing well.
Once you have private health insurance, there is usually no going back, even if you have difficulties earning the rising contributions at some point. On the other hand, good private insurers offer you a range of services that can exceed the quality of statutory health insurance - you just have to ask yourself how important this is to you personally.
